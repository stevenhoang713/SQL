# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

# 1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> '';

# 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND orderID <> ''
AND product = 'iPhone';

# 3.  Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT 
  distinct product, 
  ROUND(SUM(quantity)*price,0) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

# 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
  product
  ,SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
  ,SUM(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

# 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
  COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum)
  ,ROUND(AVG((quantity*price)),2) as avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE quantity > 2
